                        <p>Hey, my name is Vincent and I’m a web developer with extensive experience in computer and database programming.</p>
                        <p>For the past 15+ years, I’ve been responsible for the full development life cycle of a legacy business application written in COBOL. Over the years, I’ve implemented SQL techniques to more efficiently access and process data. An example of this is there were COBOL programs written, with hundreds of lines of code, to read through a file, retrieve related data from several other files and combine the data to create an output file. You can easily replace these types of programs with a single SQL statement, that joins and summarizes the data and outputs the same data in the necessary format.</p>
                        <p>I’ve also developed several windows GUI programs using VisualBasic.NET as the front-end program and utilized Microsoft SQL Server and DB2 for i as back-end databases.</p>
                        <p>In addition, I also was able to teach myself enough about Linux, PHP and MySQL to make enhancements and fixes to my company’s website that was written by an outside vendor using the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack.</p>
                        <p>Another project that I’ve been relied upon for is utilizing Big Data analysis techniques, applied to millions of data records to summarize, join and process the data to create spreadsheets that were then utilized by our auditors to generate claims, resulting in hundreds of thousands of dollars being paid to us, plus more pending, that otherwise would have been forfeited.</p>
                        <p>I recently completed an intensive, full stack web development boot camp provided by Rutgers University. The boot camp enabled me to update my skill-set with modern technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, Express, React and React Native. I can use these technologies to create awesome, responsive websites, apps, back-end and PC programs. I really enjoyed going through this boot camp as it has opened my eyes to so many possibilities and opportunities to create robust websites and applications and I look forward to continuing down the path of modern application development.</p>
